INSTRUCTIONS = """\
Query the FRINK federated SPARQL endpoint over the Proto-OKN knowledge graphs.

Workflow:
1. Call `list_kgs` to see the available knowledge graphs and their descriptions,
   then choose which one(s) are relevant to the question.
2. Optionally call `describe_kg` for richer prose context on a chosen KG.
3. Call `get_schema` for each chosen KG to learn its classes, predicates, and
   property names BEFORE writing SPARQL — each KG has its own schema.
3b. When a predicate's objects are ontology terms (diseases, chemicals, genes),
   call `probe_namespaces(shortname, predicate)` to see which IDENTIFIER SCHEME /
   ontology actually populates them (e.g. DOID vs MONDO, NCBI Gene vs Ensembl vs
   symbol) and how many of each. Do NOT assume one ontology and give up when its
   path is sparse — pick the richest namespace, and prefer one with a hierarchy
   in ubergraph (MONDO/CHEBI/…) so you can expand categories via `subClassOf*`.
   If the ontology id you need isn't on an obvious predicate, call
   `find_crosswalks(shortname)` — ids are often linked via `rdfs:seeAlso`,
   `owl:sameAs`, or `skos:exactMatch`, which `get_schema` may omit or bury.
3c. When the question spans TWO KGs, call `get_join_strategy(kg_a, kg_b)` FIRST,
   before `find_crosswalks`. It returns a precomputed, hand-verified join recipe
   (predicates, roles, shared id, the `iri_normalization` rewrite to apply, and a
   verified count) — fast and reliable, where `find_crosswalks` scans live and
   often times out. Respect its answer: `known_non_join` means that pair was
   checked and does NOT join on the obvious key — do not retry it; only on
   `unknown` should you fall back to `find_crosswalks` to discover a key live.
4. Call `sparql_query` with a SPARQL query that scopes each KG with
   `GRAPH <https://purl.org/okn/frink/kg/{shortname}> { ... }`. A single query
   may span multiple named graphs (that is the point of federation).

TRANSCRIPTS: Substantive `sparql_query`/`expand_ontology_term` calls are logged
automatically — but queries that error or return no rows are NOT logged, and you
can pass `exploratory=True` to `sparql_query` to keep schema-probing or
trial-and-error queries out of the record. Call `reset_query_log` at the START of
an analysis to scope the log, and `create_chat_transcript` at the END to emit a
reproducible markdown record (prompts, answers, and the verbatim queries +
results that actually produced findings). For each turn's `answer`, paste your
COMPLETE response text as the user saw it — the full report, findings, tables,
and explanation — NOT a condensed recap. The server only logs tool calls, never
your prose, so a summarized `answer` is lost detail that cannot be recovered.
SAVE the full transcript markdown the
tool returns — verbatim and complete — as a downloadable `.md` file via your
file-creation capability (the same behavior as "save the transcript as a file":
the `.md` appears in the preview panel, downloadable from the chat); a Markdown
ARTIFACT / document does the same. A sentence describing it is not enough. Only
if you cannot write a file, output the complete markdown in a fenced ```markdown
block. NEVER say the transcript is "ready", "in the preview panel", or "saved"
unless you actually wrote the file or emitted its full content — do not fabricate
a preview. (The rendered markdown is also published as the MCP resource
`transcript://session/latest`, which a client can fetch/save directly even for
remote servers.)

ONTOLOGY EXPANSION (read this before answering "all X under category Y" questions):
Whenever a question covers a CATEGORY of ontology terms — e.g. "all
cardiovascular diseases", "any kind of asthma", "diseases that are subtypes of
X", "chemicals in class Y" — you MUST expand the category using `ubergraph`'s
PRECOMPUTED transitive closure with a property path, in ONE query:

    ?descendant rdfs:subClassOf* <parent-term-IRI>   # category + all subtypes

Ubergraph already materialises every inferred edge, so this returns the complete
subtree in a single step. Use `*` (reflexive) to INCLUDE the category term
itself — usually what you want for "all X" questions; use `+` if you want strict
subtypes only and must exclude the term itself.

Do NOT, under any circumstances:
  - fetch the ontology tree level by level / walk children iteratively;
  - retrieve the hierarchy "separately" and then filter in your head;
  - enumerate subtypes by hand or guess them.

PREFER a single FEDERATED query that expands the category in the `ubergraph`
graph and joins the expanded terms against the target KG in the same query, e.g.
"find all cardiovascular diseases (MONDO:0004995) mentioned in <kg>":

    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    SELECT DISTINCT ?disease ?label WHERE {
      GRAPH <https://purl.org/okn/frink/kg/ubergraph> {
        ?disease rdfs:subClassOf* <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/MONDO_0004995> .
        OPTIONAL { ?disease rdfs:label ?label }
      }
      GRAPH <https://purl.org/okn/frink/kg/SOME_TARGET_KG> {
        ?record some:predicate ?disease .
      }
    }

If you only need the list of terms in the category (no join), call
`expand_ontology_term` instead of writing the query yourself.

CHOOSE THE RIGHT ONTOLOGY (do this before picking a parent-term IRI):
A KG may reference the same domain through more than one ontology — e.g. disease
via BOTH DOID and MONDO, or genes via NCBI Gene, Ensembl, AND symbol. Do NOT
assume which one a KG uses or default to the first that comes to mind: call
`get_schema(target_kg)` and/or run a small `exploratory=True` `sparql_query` that
samples the actual predicate/object IRIs in that graph, and confirm which
ontology is actually stored. If several are present, pick the one with the right
coverage for the question. Anchor the `subClassOf*` expansion on a term IRI from
the ontology the KG ACTUALLY uses — expanding MONDO when the KG only links DOID
(or vice versa) silently returns no rows.

SCHEMA.ORG URIs: `https://schema.org/...` in a query is rewritten to
`http://schema.org/...` automatically before it runs — the KGs store the
canonical `http://` form, and the two are distinct IRIs to the engine. You may
write either scheme; both match.

SCHEMA VISUALIZATION: `visualize_schema` returns a ready-made Mermaid diagram,
pre-wrapped in a fenced block as `mermaid_block`. Output that `mermaid_block`
VERBATIM and nothing else. Do NOT redraw it as SVG/PNG/HTML/an image/an artifact
or a hand-built diagram — Mermaid clients render the fenced block natively, and
producing your own graphic yields a messy, incorrect picture.

IMPORTANT: Only the federation endpoint is used. Do not attempt to use the
per-KG SPARQL endpoints — they are not exposed and time out on complex queries.

    The mapping-predicate scan (`_crosswalk_query`) is blind to ids that aren't

    node IRI itself (rdkg's diseases are `obo/MONDO_…` IRIs) or carried by an

    nodes — i.e. how many join keys exist. ``sample > 0`` caps the scan via an

    The two roles are deliberately SEPARATE queries (run concurrently by

    splitting them means that fruitless scan can't take the productive one down

    """Find ontology/database ids in a KG, however they are encoded.

    Ontology ids (MONDO, CHEBI, NCBI Gene, …) hide in THREE places, and a KG that
    "lacks" the id you need usually just encodes it somewhere non-obvious. This
    profiles all three at once:

    1. MAPPING predicates — `rdfs:seeAlso`, `owl:sameAs`, `schema:sameAs`, the
       SKOS `*Match` predicates, `oboInOwl:hasDbXref`. Generic, so `get_schema`
       often omits them or buries them among hundreds of predicates. Returned
       under `crosswalks`, per predicate.
    2. NODE IRIs — the entity's OWN IRI is the ontology term (rdkg's diseases ARE
       `obo/MONDO_…` IRIs; ids may also be `identifiers.org/…`). No mapping
       predicate exists; you join DIRECTLY on the node IRI. Returned under
       `ontology_ids` with `role="subject"`.
    3. DOMAIN predicates — the id is the object of an arbitrary, KG-specific
       predicate (not one of the mapping set). Returned under `ontology_ids`
       with `role="object"` and the carrying predicate.

    Cases 2 and 3 are invisible to a mapping-predicate-only scan — they are
    exactly why `find_crosswalks` used to return empty for KGs (rdkg, oard-kg,
    biobricks-ice, biomarkerkg) that in fact carry rich ontology ids. Use this
    whenever a KG seems to lack the identifier you need on its obvious predicates.

    Args:
        shortname: KG shortname (e.g. `prokn`), as returned by `list_kgs`.
        sample: 0 (default) counts exactly; a positive N caps each scan via an
            inner `LIMIT` for KGs where a predicate or the node-IRI scan is very
            large. Counts are then over the sample, not the graph.

    Returns:
        `{"shortname", "crosswalks": [{"predicate", "predicate_iri", "namespaces":
        [{"namespace", "count"}, ...], "total"}, ...], "ontology_ids": [{"role",
        "namespace", "count", "predicates": [...]}, ...], "sampled"}`.
        `crosswalks` lists mapping predicates (busiest first; namespaces by count
        desc). `ontology_ids` lists ids encoded as node IRIs (`role="subject"`) or
        as domain-predicate objects (`role="object"`), one row per id family,
        busiest first; `count` is DISTINCT ids — i.e. how many join keys — and
        `predicates` are the edges they ride on. Any OBO prefix (MONDO/CHEBI/…) can
        be joined to ubergraph's `rdfs:subClassOf*`. When `ontology_ids` shows a
        `subject`-role namespace, the join is direct: the KG's nodes ARE those
        IRIs, so `?s` already equals the ontology term in the other graph.

    CROSS-KG BRIDGING: when a KG stores ids in an EXTERNAL IRI form that no
    ontology shares directly (e.g. ProKN's diseases as `https://www.omim.org/
    entry/100100`), two bridges through `ubergraph` work:
      1. `oboInOwl:hasDbXref` — MONDO/HP/CHEBI terms hold CURIE cross-refs
         (`OMIM:100100`, `UMLS:C...`, `MESH:D...`). Extract the bare id from the
         KG's IRI, rebuild the CURIE, and join `?mondo oboInOwl:hasDbXref
         "OMIM:100100"`. PREFERRED — CURIEs sidestep IRI-form mismatches.
      2. `skos:exactMatch` — MONDO terms link to OMIM as IRIs, BUT ubergraph uses
         `https://omim.org/entry/100100` while ProKN uses `https://www.omim.org/
         entry/100100` (note the missing `www.`). A direct join silently matches
         nothing; rewrite at query time, e.g. `BIND(IRI(REPLACE(STR(?omim),
         "://www\\.omim", "://omim")) AS ?ug_omim)`, then join on `?ug_omim`.
    Either way ubergraph also gives you the `subClassOf*` hierarchy. Beware IRI-
    form drift across graphs generally (subdomain, http/https, trailing slash).

    This is an exploratory probe — it is NOT recorded in the session/transcript.

        last run on `verified_on`. When two recipes link the same entity through
        different identifiers (e.g. direct MONDO AND an OMIM bridge), each carries

    """Build a runnable query for the NCBITaxon overlap between two KGs.

    The taxonomy crosswalks are a HUB: each KG joins `ubergraph` (see
    `list_crosswalks`, domain "Taxonomy"), not each other — so the table stores no
    direct pairwise count. This tool composes two hub spokes THROUGH ubergraph into
    a runnable skeleton you then execute with `query` / federation (it does not run
    it — federated taxonomy joins can be heavy).

    Pairwise taxon overlap is NOT single-valued; two skeletons are returned:
      * `exact_id_skeleton` — taxa carrying the SAME NCBITaxon id in both KGs
        (strict intersection).
      * `clade_membership_skeleton` — `kg_b` taxa nested under `kg_a`'s taxa via
        ubergraph `subClassOf*`. This can be FAR larger when one side is
        coarser-grained (e.g. genus names vs strain-level taxids); it is
        directional, so swap `kg_a`/`kg_b` to flip which side is the clade. The
        exact-id count understating a real biological overlap is the #1 trap here.

    Each side applies its KG's own id normalization (PATRIC genome id, UniProt
    taxonomy IRI, label resolution, …). Materialized counts (exact-id + both clade
    directions) are returned under `materialized_overlap` when the pair has a
    non-zero overlap precomputed in the NCBITaxon hub (see `list_crosswalks`); a
    verified pairwise crosswalk recipe (e.g. spoke-genelab<->spoke-okn, D9) is
    returned under `materialized` so you can use the stored count instead of
    re-running.

    The federation ships a curated, hand-verified table of join recipes between
    knowledge graphs. `get_join_strategy` narrows it to one KG or one pair; this
    returns the whole map at once, so you can discover which graphs connect —
    and on what shared identifier — without knowing the pair in advance. Each row
    is a compact summary; call `get_join_strategy(kg_a, kg_b)` for a pair's full
    recipe (predicates, roles, IRI-normalization snippet, counts).

    Args:
        include_examples: when True (default), each row carries an
            `example_question` describing what the join answers. Set False for a
            more compact listing.

    Returns:
        `{"verified_on", "count", "crosswalks": [...], "taxon_clade_note"?}`. Rows
        are sorted by `(domain, shared_key)`, so the list reads as a table grouped
        by `domain` (e.g. "Genes", "Geospatial", "Disease & phenotype") and ordered
        by ontology within each — render it directly as such. `kgs` lists every KG
        the join touches in join order (left → bridge → right), each an official
        registry shortname usable directly with `describe_kg`/`get_schema`/`query`.
        Most rows carry a single `verified_count`; `verified_on` dates the counts.

        The NCBITaxon crosswalks are a hub (each KG joins `ubergraph`); rather than
        list each KG's overlap with that plumbing, the listing shows ONE row PER
        non-zero KG pair, composed through the hub (`kgs: [kg_a, "ubergraph",
        kg_b]`, `bridge_kg: "ubergraph"`, `hub: "ubergraph"`). These rows have NO
        single `verified_count`; the overlap is two-valued — `exact_id` (taxa with
        the same NCBITaxon id, symmetric) plus directional `clade_a_in_b` /
        `clade_b_in_a` (taxa nested under the other KG's clades via `subClassOf*`,
        often far larger). When the result includes Taxonomy rows it also carries a
        top-level `taxon_clade_note`: RENDER IT as a short paragraph AFTER the table
        so the reader understands the two columns. `taxon_overlap(kg_a, kg_b)`
        returns the runnable skeletons.

        Rows where `ubergraph` is a bare endpoint (a KG's overlap with the ontology
        backbone, not a KG-to-KG join — e.g. oard-kg's MONDO terms, biobricks-mesh's
        MeSH terms) are omitted from this listing; they remain available via

    provenance (date, model version, knowledge graphs, endpoint).

    Queries come from the automatic session log: each `sparql_query` /

            (e.g. `claude-opus-4-8`). Use the exact model ID.
        exchanges: The conversation turns, in order. Each is a dict with

            NOT a high-level summary or paraphrase. The server cannot see your
            prose (only tool calls are logged), so whatever you omit here is gone
            from the transcript. Err toward including too much. You may also attach an
            explicit `queries` list per turn (same shape as the log entries) if
            you want queries shown inline with a specific prompt instead of —
            or in addition to — the auto-logged appendix. Attach ONLY queries
            that produced findings; never attach exploratory/schema-probing
            queries. A query's optional `description` is a plain, user-facing
            label of what the query finds (e.g. "Diseases linked to PFAS") —
            never internal bookkeeping such as "(exploratory, not logged)",
            "(intermediate)", or notes about logging state.
        kgs_used: Shortnames of the knowledge graphs queried. If omitted, they
            are inferred from the logged queries. Each is expanded to its
            federation named-graph URI.
        date: ISO date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) of the session. Defaults to today.
        format: `markdown` (default) for a rendered document string, or `json`
            for the structured fields.
        title: Heading for the transcript.
        include_query_log: If true (default), append the auto-logged queries
            as a "SPARQL queries executed" section.
        include_intermediate_rows: If false (default), only the FINAL logged
            query renders its full result table; earlier (intermediate) queries
            show their SPARQL, row count, and a compact PREVIEW of the rows (a
            single-row result in full, otherwise the first 3 rows), to keep the
            transcript focused on the queries that produced the findings. Set
            true to render the full result rows for every logged query.
            (Queries attached inline to an exchange via `queries` always render
            in full, regardless of this flag.)
        include_visualizations: If true (default), append a "Schema
            visualizations" section with every `visualize_schema` diagram logged
            this session, each in a fenced ```mermaid block. These are recorded
            automatically — you do NOT need to re-supply them.

    Returns:
        For `markdown`: the transcript string. Each conversation turn is
        rendered in the mcp-proto-okn style — a "👤 **User**" block (the prompt)
        and a "🧠 **Assistant**" block (the answer), separated by a rule — with
        queries in fenced ```sparql blocks (plus result tables) and schema
        diagrams in fenced ```mermaid blocks under the answer.
        For `json`: a dict with `title`, `date`, `model`, `exchanges`,
        `knowledge_graphs`, `query_log`, `visualizations`, and
        `sparql_endpoint`.

    OUTPUT HANDLING (required): SAVE the transcript as a downloadable file.
    Write the full markdown returned by this tool — verbatim and in its
    entirety — to a `.md` file using your file-creation capability (the same
    thing that happens when a user says "save the transcript as a file": the
    `.md` is written and shown in the preview panel, downloadable directly from
    the chat). A Markdown ARTIFACT / document achieves the same result (Claude
    Desktop and claude.ai render it in a side panel the user can save as `.md`
    or export to PDF; a hosted `present_files`-style tool also works). Creating
    the file is the goal — a sentence describing or summarizing the transcript
    is NOT a substitute.

    Only if you genuinely cannot write a file or artifact, fall back to
    outputting the complete markdown in a fenced ```markdown block in your reply
    so the user can copy/save it.

    NEVER claim the transcript is "ready", "in the preview panel", or "saved"
    unless you actually wrote the file (or emitted its full content) — do not
    fabricate a preview. Either the file exists / the document content is present
    in your response, or you state plainly that you could not produce it.

    The rendered markdown is also published as the read-only MCP resource
    `transcript://session/latest`, so a client can fetch/save it directly
    (transport-agnostic; works for remote servers) regardless of how you present
    it. You may point the user there.
